React Native Auth Flow with Node.js, MongoDB, and JWT
1. Overview
This guide explains how to implement a full authentication flow using React Native on the frontend and
Node.js, MongoDB, and JWT on the backend. Users can register, login, stay logged in across sessions, and
logout.
2. Backend Setup (Node.js + MongoDB)
- Install packages: express, mongoose, bcryptjs, cors, dotenv, jsonwebtoken
- Created user schema and REST endpoints for /register and /login
- Register hashes password and stores in MongoDB
- Login verifies credentials and returns a JWT token
3. Frontend Setup (React Native)
- Built screens: LoginScreen, RegisterScreen, HomeScreen, ProfileScreen
- Used React Navigation for routing
- AuthContext handles login, logout, register, and token persistence with AsyncStorage
- Used useContext to access auth globally
- AsyncStorage used to store JWT securely
- Root.js decides which screen stack to show based on login status
4. Key Concepts & Definitions
- useState: React Hook that lets you add state to function components.
- useEffect: Hook for running side effects like fetching data or checking login status when the component
mounts.
- useContext: Allows consuming data from a React context like AuthContext.
- AsyncStorage: Local storage system for React Native to persist data.
- JWT (JSON Web Token): A secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. Used
here to authenticate users.
- AuthContext: A React Context that provides and manages authentication state and functions across the
app.
- NavigationContainer & Stack.Navigator: From React Navigation, they provide routing and screen transitions

based on auth state.
5. Flow Summary
1. User registers -> credentials are hashed and saved to MongoDB
2. User logs in -> password is checked, JWT is returned
3. JWT is saved in AsyncStorage and used to determine if user is logged in
4. Protected screens (Home/Profile) are shown only if token exists
5. Logout removes token and returns to login/register screen
6. Conclusion
You now have a secure and scalable authentication flow using React Native and Node.js backend. This
structure can be extended to include profile data, token verification on protected routes, password reset, et
